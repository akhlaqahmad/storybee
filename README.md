## Project Overview

StoryBee is an innovative platform designed to generate creative and personalized stories for kids using artificial intelligence. Our goal is to foster imaginations and support children's learning through engaging AI-generated narratives, tailored to fit individual preferences. Whether for bedtime stories or educational content, StoryBee combines interactive storytelling with beautiful illustrations, allowing both parents and children to collaborate in crafting unique tales.
